## 1. Metrical Analysis of Latin Verses
As a Classics researcher
I want to automatically identify the meter and foot structure of Latin verses
So that I can perform metrical analysis on poems without manually scanning each line.

## User Case: 
The user inputs a Latin poem, and the tool scans each line to identify metrical patterns (e.g., dactylic hexameter, elegiac couplet).
The tool highlights each foot in the verse, allowing users to visually verify scansion.
Output includes a summary of the meter and any irregularities detected, aiding the user in identifying unique metrical features.


## 2. Rhythm Pattern Mapping Across Stanzas
As a Classics researcher interested in rhythmic variation
I want a tool that maps rhythm and stress patterns across multiple stanzas
So that I can identify rhythmic shifts and recurring patterns that contribute to the poem’s overall structure and mood.

## User Case:

The user inputs a multi-stanza poem, and the tool visualizes the rhythm and stress pattern of each stanza in sequence.
A graphical output shows how long and short syllables, as well as stressed and unstressed beats, vary or repeat across stanzas, enabling pattern recognition.
This feature provides insights into how rhythmic changes reinforce thematic elements or emotional progression, helping the researcher understand the structure and pacing of the poem on a larger scale.

## 3. Visualizing Rhythm and Stress Patterns
As a Latin poetry researcher interested in auditory analysis
I want a feature to visualize the rhythm and stress patterns of a poem
So that I can understand the poem’s auditory impact and perform better prosodic analysis.

## User Case:

The user inputs a verse, and the tool generates a graphical representation of stress patterns, mapping long and short syllables visually.
The output includes an option to play an audio rendering of the poem with correct rhythm and stress, simulating the traditional performance.
This helps the researcher explore how rhythm influences the reading and interpretation of Latin poetry.

## 4. Comparative Metrical Analysis Across Poems

As a Latin poetry scholar
I want to compare metrical patterns across multiple poems or authors
So that I can analyze stylistic variations in metrical choices and determine if certain meters correlate with specific themes or genres.

## User Case:

The user inputs several poems or selects from a pre-existing corpus.
The tool conducts a metrical analysis on each poem, identifying meters and summarizing the frequency and distribution of each.
Results are displayed in a comparative table or chart format, allowing the user to visually assess metrical trends across texts, such as the prevalence of dactylic hexameter in epic poetry versus the elegiac couplet in love poetry.

## 5. Foot Structure Visualization and Analysis
As a student learning Latin poetry structure
I want to visualize each foot’s structure within a line
So that I can better understand the function and rhythm of different feet in Latin meter.

## User Case:

The user inputs a line of poetry, and the tool automatically breaks it down into feet, displaying each foot separately and indicating long and short syllables.
The tool provides visual cues, such as color-coding for stressed and unstressed syllables, and brief descriptions of each foot type (e.g., dactyl, spondee).
The output aids the user in recognizing patterns and appreciating how each foot contributes to the overall rhythm, enhancing their ability to scan lines independently in the future.
