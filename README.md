CSE 583 Final Project

**Why carmina?**
> *Carmina* is the Latin word for songs or poems. It's a working title, and I don't mind changing it further down the line.

## Goals
- To create a Python package for Classicists to automate reading processes for analyzing poetry

## Values
- Little to no Python knowledge should be required to work with the package
- Readability and comprehensibility to someone who doesn't know a lot of coding in general
- Minimal to no object-oriented programming
- Possibly notebook-based applications (Colab?)
- Focus on File I/O and function calling
- Have as few dependencies as possible outside of base Python

## Tasks

Specific tasks will be given their own issues and assignees. Here is a high-level summary for what we want to achieve.

### File Read-in
We need to be able to parse XML files into some useable format, probably a string. We can use XMLs from Perseus as a guide.

### Scansion - Dactylic Hexameter
One of the hallmarks of poetic analysis is being able to scan lines of poetry, or determine their meter. This function, when given an input, should be able to parse a line and return the scansion of that line.

## Stretch Goals

### Scansion - Other meters
Expanding the `scansion` function to include other meters, like elegaic couplet, iambic trimeter, etc.

### Graphical Interface
Doing away with the low-level code altogether and creating a site/app where users can input their files and work with a UI instead.

## Repository Organization
To be updated as more files are added
