# carmina
CSE 583 Final Project

**Project Members:**
- Suh Young Choi
- Simon Dovan Nguyen

**Why carmina?**
> *Carmina* is the Latin word for songs or poems. It's a working title, and I don't mind changing it further down the line.

## Goals
- To create a Python package for Classicists to automate reading processes for analyzing poetry

## Values
- Little to no Python knowledge should be required to work with the package
- Readability and comprehensibility to someone who doesn't know a lot of coding in general

## Tasks
TBA.

## Stretch Goals
TBA.

## Repository Organization
To be updated as more files are added
