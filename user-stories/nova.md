# Describing a Use Case 
Implied use cases: think about any implied cases: 
The tool is not very interactive. The user inputs their file/latin piece and the tool displays: metrical analysis. So as long as the user provides the file, that should be it. 
## Validation/authentication: 
Make sure it’s latin 
Limit file sizes and type of file: html or txt. Or html. 
It has to be poetry: (1) new line characters. Common files used for latin poetry: xml or txt. 
## What does the output look like? 
Our output: it’s text with symbols (so dash and ‘u’ ‘-‘). Perhaps a way to let the user download it as an image or pdf?
