## Case Studies based on user stories 

## Dr. Julia (University Professor) 
**Inputs:** Text Selection - verses from Aeneid for analysis. Meter type - specifically dactylic hexameter. 
Output format - optipn to generate a report format compatible with presentation tools or export to txt or xml.file.   
**Outputs:** Detailed metrical analysis with dactylic and spondaic foot patterns marked line-by-line.
Identification of anomalies or substitutions within the metrical structure.
Exportable reports (txt. or xml) for use in classroom presentations.
 
 
## Alex (Graduate Student in Classics)  
**Inputs:** Text Selection – Verses from works by Lucan, specifically Pharsalia.
Deviations Parameter – Option to identify deviations from traditional dactylic hexameter.
Visualization Option – Simple graphs or charts for metrical variations.  
**Outputs:** Identification and annotation of deviations within metrical structure.
Basic visualization of deviations (e.g., bar graphs or line charts).
Documentation or tooltips to assist with function parameter explanations. 

## Maria (High School Latin Teacher) 
**Inputs:** Text Selection – Lines from Ovid’s poetry for introductory-level metrical analysis.
Simplified View Option – A toggle to reduce complexity in output.  
**Outputs:** Simplified output labeling each foot within a line of poetry (e.g., ‘dactyl,’ ‘spondee’).
Minimal, easy-to-read output format suitable for beginner-level users.
Clear, step-by-step instructions or tooltips on how to input text and interpret the output.
   
## Dr. Roberto (Digital Humanities Researcher)
**Inputs:** Batch Processing Option – Large corpus of Latin poetry spanning multiple authors.
Custom Meter Selection – Ability to specify and customize meter types.
Integration Compatibility – Export functionality in data-friendly formats. 
**Outputs:** Batch processing results with annotations for metrical patterns in large text collections.
Flexible data output formats that integrate with data analysis tools. (would txt or xml files work for him?)..
Customizable reports allowing the comparison of meter patterns across texts or authors.  

## Sarah (Undergraduate Classics and Data Science Student) 
**Inputs:** Text Selection – Shorter sections of text for small-scale analysis.
Guided Mode – Step-by-step prompts or example datasets for learning.
Error Messages – Clear and descriptive feedback if an input error occurs. 
**Outputs:** Analysis of metrical patterns on a small scale, ideal for focused studies.
Accessible output with clear documentation explaining each part of the result.
Contextual error messages or tips for troubleshooting, to support beginner-friendly usage   

## User Case: 
The user inputs a Latin poem, and the tool scans each line to identify metrical patterns (e.g., dactylic hexameter, elegiac couplet).
The tool highlights each foot in the verse, allowing users to visually verify scansion.
Output includes a summary of the meter and any irregularities detected, aiding the user in identifying unique metrical features.

## User Case:
The user inputs a multi-stanza poem, and the tool visualizes the rhythm and stress pattern of each stanza in sequence.
A graphical output shows how long and short syllables, as well as stressed and unstressed beats, vary or repeat across stanzas, enabling pattern recognition.
This feature provides insights into how rhythmic changes reinforce thematic elements or emotional progression, helping the researcher understand the structure and pacing of the poem on a larger scale.

## User Case:
The user inputs a verse, and the tool generates a graphical representation of stress patterns, mapping long and short syllables visually.
The output includes an option to play an audio rendering of the poem with correct rhythm and stress, simulating the traditional performance.
This helps the researcher explore how rhythm influences the reading and interpretation of Latin poetry.


## User Case:
The user inputs several poems or selects from a pre-existing corpus.
The tool conducts a metrical analysis on each poem, identifying meters and summarizing the frequency and distribution of each.
Results are displayed in a comparative table or chart format, allowing the user to visually assess metrical trends across texts, such as the prevalence of dactylic hexameter in epic poetry versus the elegiac couplet in love poetry.


## User Case:
The user inputs a line of poetry, and the tool automatically breaks it down into feet, displaying each foot separately and indicating long and short syllables.
The tool provides visual cues, such as color-coding for stressed and unstressed syllables, and brief descriptions of each foot type (e.g., dactyl, spondee).
The output aids the user in recognizing patterns and appreciating how each foot contributes to the overall rhythm, enhancing their ability to scan lines independently in the future.

# Use Cases
- **Virgil:** Using the hexameter scanning tool to verify that his own poetry is in the correct meter
- **Cicero:** Using the text reuse finder to search a piece of poetry for recurring text
- **Vitruvius:** Using the alliteration finder across lines of poetry, probably at the beginnings of words
- **Hypatia:** Using the alliteration finder within one line, probably at the beginnings of syllables
- **Julius:** Using the hexameter scanning tool to scan unfamiliar lines of poetry.
