## Case Studies based on user stories 

## Dr. Julia (University Professor) 
**Inputs:** Text Selection - verses from Aeneid for analysis. Meter type - specifically dactylic hexameter. 
Output format - optipn to generate a report format compatible with presentation tools or export to txt or xml.file.   
**Outputs:** Detailed metrical analysis with dactylic and spondaic foot patterns marked line-by-line.
Identification of anomalies or substitutions within the metrical structure.
Exportable reports (txt. or xml) for use in classroom presentations.
 
 
## Alex (Graduate Student in Classics)  
**Inputs:** Text Selection – Verses from works by Lucan, specifically Pharsalia.
Deviations Parameter – Option to identify deviations from traditional dactylic hexameter.
Visualization Option – Simple graphs or charts for metrical variations.  
**Outputs:** Identification and annotation of deviations within metrical structure.
Basic visualization of deviations (e.g., bar graphs or line charts).
Documentation or tooltips to assist with function parameter explanations. 

## Maria (High School Latin Teacher) 
**Inputs:** Text Selection – Lines from Ovid’s poetry for introductory-level metrical analysis.
Simplified View Option – A toggle to reduce complexity in output.
