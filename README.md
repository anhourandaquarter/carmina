**Carmina** ("songs" or "poems" in Latin) is a tool designed to assist classicists and digital 
humanities scholars in analyzing Latin poetry. Created as part of a collaborative class project for CSE 583, Carmina demonstrates students' ability to develop tools that are simple, sustainable, and meaningful.

With Carmina, users can: 
- Perform **metrical analysis** on Latin poetry. 
- Work with files in **.txt** and **.xml** formats.

Carmina emphasizes ease of use and accesibility by relying on dependencies that are simple to install and use, designed for those with little programming experience.
